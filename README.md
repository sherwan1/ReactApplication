The React Application that I have created is a basic application which is relates to fixtures, results and teams in soccer. The application is quite intuitive but I can still explain how to use it. There exists a navigation bar which has three cells in it named "Home" which takes you to the Home page. The other three cells fixtures, results, teams are drop down menus which are expanded when a mouse hovers over it and collapsed upon disappearance of the mouse. When you select any of the cells from fixtures or results in the drop down menu, for example "Manchester United", it will take you to the corresponding page which tells the match information regarding the teams. The "Teams" cell in the nav bar just lists all the teams that are used in the application when a mouse hovers over it. There are two ways to use react components in different files and have different css files for coresponding components but I used the one with just one JS file "index.js" where I am splitting the code into different components and having one css file called "index.css".
